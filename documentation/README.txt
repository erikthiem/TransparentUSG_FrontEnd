TransparentUSG Front End Readme File

If you're reading this, thank you very much for checking out this project!
The aim of this web app is to increase transparency within Ohio State's
Undergraduate Student Government. This app aims to do this in two parts.
It will allow students to:
    
    1. Easily view USG minutes / votes / members / etc.
    2. Allow current students to create petitions and vote on each other's 
       petitions. This will be similar to change.org. Once petitions reach
       a certain number of votes, they will be emailed to USG for consideration.

This app is developed on top of the Angular-Seed
(https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) project.

To run the frontend, navigate to the /code directory and type "npm start". This
will create a local server. Navigate to "localhost:8000/app" in a web browser
to see the app.

This front end uses a Trello for project management. The link to this
